# Sitecore-XM-Integrations
## Sitecore-XM-Integrations for Composible DXP Solutions


### Sitecore.Foundation.Extensions Project (Now included in the main Solution)
1. This includes build-in extension method functionality for the client's wanting to integrate with a Traditional Sitecore XM/XP instance implementation 
    - These extension methods can be accessed via the following files under the src\Middleware\src\SitecoreExtensions\code folder:
        - \Extensions\FieldExtensions.cs => Extension methods for Sitecore Field Item object from the Sitecore XM/XP instance        
            - Please see the method comments/documentation (auto generated by the GhostDoc tool), that provides the correct code documentation for this file
        - \Extensions\ItemExtensions.cs => Extension methods for Sitecore Item objects from the Sitecore XM/XP instance
            - Please see the method comments/documentation (auto generated by the GhostDoc tool), that provides the correct code documentation for this file
        - \Extensions\SitecoreLoggingExtensions.cs => Extension methods for Sitecore Field Item object from the Sitecore XM/XP instance
            - This method can be used with or without a Sitecore XM/XP instance
            - Note the LogException() method contains the following configurable params
                - createCustomLogFile (bool param) => Which determines the logging exceptions in a newly created custom log file/s or in 
                the default Sitecore XM/XP created log files. Note the param should always be passed in as true if the client is not using a Sitecore XM/XP instance
                - appLogFileKey (string param) => This applies an application prefix key to the name of the custom file being created. 
                    - Note: if the appLogFileKey is empty the fallback file prefix key will be applied as 'CustomApiLogs'
                    - Note: 1 log file gets created per day per application (i.e. if you have more than 1 site/application under the webroot).
                    - Note: a Sitecore XM/XP instance can handle as many sites/applications under the same webroot (each with there own Domain Url and branding and layout)
            - Note the LogApiResponseMessages() and LogExceptionNotification() methods contains the following configrable params
                - These methods can be used with or without a Sitecore XM/XP instance, i.e. will always create custom log files
                - appLogFileKey (string param) => This applies an application prefix key to the name of the custom file being created. 
                    - Note: if the appLogFileKey is empty the fallback file prefix key will be applied as 'CustomApiLogs'
                    - Note: 1 log file gets created per day per application (i.e. if you have more than 1 site/application under the webroot).
                    - Note: a Sitecore XM/XP instance can handle as many sites/applications under the same webroot (each with there own Domain Url and branding and layout)
            - Please see the method comments/documentation (auto generated by the GhostDoc tool), that provides the correct code documentation for this file
        - \Extensions\HTMLHelperExtensions.cs => Extension methods for handling MvcHtmlString repsonses on Sitecore Item object's data values from the Sitecore XM/XP instance
            - Please see the method comments/documentation (auto generated by the GhostDoc tool), that provides the correct code documentation for this file
