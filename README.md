#### Summary Documention 
1. This includes build-in extension method functionality for the client's wanting to integrate with a Traditional Sitecore XM/XP instance implementation 
    - These extension methods can be accessed via the following files under the src\Middleware\src\SitecoreExtensions\code folder:
        - \Extensions\FieldExtensions.cs => Extension methods for Sitecore Field Item object from the Sitecore XM/XP instance        
            - Please see the method comments/documentation (auto generated by the GhostDoc tool), that provides the correct code documentation for this file
